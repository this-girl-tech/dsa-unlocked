📍 DSA Roadmap (Beginner → Advanced)

A clean, structured roadmap to master Data Structures & Algorithms — even if you're starting from zero.

⭐ Week 0 – Setup (Optional but Helpful)

Before starting DSA, get these ready:

Choose a language: C++ / Java / Python / JavaScript

Create accounts on: LeetCode, GFG, InterviewBit

Install VS Code / JetBrains / Online IDE

🚀 Week 1 — Foundations
1. Time & Space Complexity

Big-O notation

Common complexities

Best / Worst / Avg case

Space complexity basics

2. Arrays (Core Foundation)

Iteration

Searching

In-place updates

Prefix sums

Kadane’s Algorithm (intro)

3. Strings

String manipulation

Frequency maps

Palindrome basics

🚀 Week 2 — Essential Data Structures
1. Linked Lists

Single / Double

Slow & Fast Pointer

Reversal (Iterative + Recursive)

Detect cycle

2. Stacks

Parentheses

Min Stack

Stack using arrays / linked list

3. Queues

Circular queue

Deque

Queue via stacks

🚀 Week 3 — Hashing + Two Pointers + Sliding Window
1. HashMaps

Counting

HashSet

Two-sum variations

Subarray sums

Frequency table patterns

2. Two Pointers

Reverse array

Pair sum

3-sum

Move zeroes

Remove duplicates

3. Sliding Window

Max sum subarray

Longest substring without repeating chars

Frequency window patterns

🚀 Week 4 — Recursion + Backtracking + Sorting
1. Recursion

Base case, recursive case

Fibonacci

Factorial

Subsets

Permutations

2. Backtracking

N-Queens

Combinations

Generate parentheses

3. Sorting & Searching

Quick sort

Merge sort

Binary search patterns

Search in rotated array

Peak element

🚀 Week 5 — Trees (Very Important)
1. Binary Trees

Preorder / Inorder / Postorder

Level order

Height / Diameter

Balanced tree

2. Binary Search Trees (BST)

Insert

Delete

Validate BST

Floor / Ceil

3. Trie (Optional)
🚀 Week 6 — Graphs
1. Graph Basics

Adjacency list / matrix

DFS

BFS

Connected components

2. Weighted Graphs

Dijkstra

Bellman-Ford

Floyd Warshall

3. Important Problems

Cycle detection

Bipartite graph

Topological sort

🚀 Week 7 — Dynamic Programming (DP)
Start with:

Fibonacci

Climbing stairs

House robber

Knapsack

Subset sum

Longest increasing subsequence (LIS)

Matrix DP

Core DP Skills

Recognizing overlapping subproblems

Memoization

Tabulation

Transition formula

🚀 Week 8 — Interview Patterns
1. Blind 75 (MUST)
2. NeetCode 150
3. Company-specific questions

Amazon

Google

Microsoft

🚀 Week 9 — Revision + Mock Interviews
1. Problem Revisiting System

Track all problems

Tag: Easy / Medium / Hard

Mark mistakes

Repeat after 7 days / 30 days

2. Mock Interviews

Use platforms:

Pramp

Interviewing.io

LeetCode contests

📌 Suggestions

Solve 2–4 problems/day

Maintain a NOTION or MD file for notes

Keep a revision cycle

Stick to one language

Don’t chase 500+ questions — chase patterns

### 🌸 Final Note

DSA is not about speed, luck, or solving 500 questions.  
It's about understanding patterns, thinking clearly, and staying consistent.

Take it one concept at a time.  
One problem at a time.  
One improvement at a time.

You've got this. 🚀
