# ⚠️ Common DSA Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

Most people don’t struggle with DSA because they’re “bad at coding”.  
They struggle because they repeat the same mistakes — again and again.

This guide highlights the **most common DSA mistakes** beginners make,  
and how to fix them early.

---

## ❌ 1. Trying to Learn Everything at Once

Jumping between:
- Arrays today  
- Trees tomorrow  
- DP next week  

This creates confusion and zero depth.

### ✅ What to do instead
Stick to **one topic** until you’re comfortable.  
Depth > Speed.

---

## ❌ 2. Solving Too Many Problems Without Understanding

Solving 10 problems a day means nothing if:
- you copy solutions  
- you can’t explain your approach  
- you forget it the next day  

### ✅ What to do instead
Solve fewer problems, but:
- understand the pattern  
- write the approach in words  
- revisit later  

---

## ❌ 3. Ignoring Time & Space Complexity

Many beginners:
- solve the problem  
- submit the solution  
- never analyze complexity  

### ✅ What to do instead
After every problem, ask:
- Why is this O(n)?
- Can it be optimized?
- What is the space cost?

---

## ❌ 4. Avoiding Hard Problems Completely

Only solving easy problems gives comfort — not growth.

### ✅ What to do instead
Solve:
- Easy → Medium → revisit  
- Even if you don’t fully solve it, *attempting* matters.

Struggle = learning.

## ❌ 5. Memorizing Solutions Instead of Patterns

Remembering exact code doesn’t help in interviews.

### ✅ What to do instead
Focus on:
- when to use a pattern  
- why it works  
- how to identify it in new problems  

---

## ❌ 6. Restarting the DSA Journey Repeatedly

Many people:
- restart roadmaps  
- restart sheets  
- restart courses  

This kills momentum.

### ✅ What to do instead
Continue from where you stopped.  
Messy progress is still progress.

---

## ❌ 7. Not Revising Old Problems

Learning without revision = forgetting.

### ✅ What to do instead
Revisit problems after:
- 7 days  
- 30 days  

Short revisions are powerful.

---

## ❌ 8. Comparing Yourself With Others

Someone else’s pace is irrelevant to yours.

### ✅ What to do instead
Track:
- your consistency  
- your understanding  
- your improvement  

That’s what actually matters.

---

## ❌ 9. Waiting to “Feel Ready”

You’ll never feel fully ready.

### ✅ What to do instead
Start anyway.
Learn while solving.
Clarity comes later.

---

## ❌ 10. Treating DSA Like a Race

DSA is not about finishing fast —  
it’s about building thinking skills.

### ✅ What to do instead
Slow down.
Understand deeply.
Build confidence over time.

## 🌸 Final Note

Everyone makes mistakes while learning DSA.  
The goal is not to avoid mistakes —  
it’s to **learn from them early**.

Stay consistent.  
Stay patient.  
You’re doing better than you think. 🚀
